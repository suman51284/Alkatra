# Alkatra
A display typeface family comprising of Bangla, Devanagari, Odia and Latin

Each typeface for each script has been designed keeping in mind the inspiration of drawing letters for wall graffitis in Bengal, India, by using a stick and tar. The forms have blobby blackness to it and have been designed for mostly display purposes.

Each script has four weights Regular, Medium, Semi-Bold and Bold and has single axis variable font as well.

The design and ideation has been spearheaded by Suman Bhandary.
The Latin has been crafted by Lewis McGuffie.

Special thanks to Nehal Mathews and Lopamudra Bose for their assistance in Odia and Devanagari
